With the query below we merged information regarding available museums and their locations with information regarding stations and their status; obtained a measure of distance between museums and stations in miles and we paired the stations with all the museums in the radius of 1 mile and half (ordering by distance); the results have then been filtered via Python to obtain exactly 5 museums for each station. 

What has been described above has been repeated in the opposite way to find for each museum the 5 closest stations. The corresponding query can be fount below. 

SELECT *, name as Station_Name,
ST_DISTANCE(stat.stat_point, mus.mus_point)/1609 as approx_distance_miles,
from bigdatatech-275815.Washington_Bikes.museums mus,
bigdatatech-275815.Washington_Bikes.Stations stat
where ST_DWITHIN( stat.stat_point,mus.mus_point, 2300) = True 
order by Station_Name, approx_distance_miles
