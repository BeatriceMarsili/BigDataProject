For a home in the city, it's massive, but for a museum, it's small. It's truly a museum/event space for locals, not tourists (though, tourists are welcome).\n\nThe Heurich House is the mansion of Christian Heurich, a German immigrant who was the oldest brewer (he died at age 102) and big time business owner in DC. Outside of the government, he owned the most amount of land and employed the most amount of people. His large brewery now houses the Kennedy Center.\n\nThis home is a historic property remembering Christian Heurich's legacy in DC. They offer tours (suggested donation of $10) Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays that last an hour long. In addition to that, they always have events from book clubs to brewing classes to a famous Christmas market every year.\n\nWhat most people don't know is they have a large garden in the back open to the public Monday-Friday from 9am-5pm. They have benches, picnic tables, and even an art gallery in the carriage house for people to enjoy for free. It's the perfect respite from the city!", "time": 1542480008}, {"author_name": "Patrick Buechner", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105247919205022500660/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-V2ReKL4DYOk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bPhnJIjd_YU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Victorian time capsule with a nice dose of German immigrant success story.
