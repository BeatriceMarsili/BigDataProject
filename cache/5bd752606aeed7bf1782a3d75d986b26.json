this is not about the actual museum exhibits or what is in it. Read to find out more.\n\nThis museum is very informational and people should go there. The problem is the incredibly disrespectful and rude staff. I was there on a school trip and they were super rude to my group leader because he didn't remember the total number of people in our full group. They acted very annoyed and were mad at us for going to the bathroom right after we got in. All we asked was where to start and they just became very agitated and annoyed. It is quite disappointing how a museum about such an awful period in the history of the world is staffed by these people. (The security was also rude, but I am not sure if they worked directly for the museum, so I didn't put them into this review for that reason.)", "time": 1597278228}, {"author_name": "Jorge Carrera", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103616404688722031979/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-f_g7_AafrSU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/uTDBVUZ3Md0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "An incredibly moving journey through a tragic and heart wrenching era in history. The United States Holocaust Museum does a masterful job of guiding you through the rise and fall of Nazi Germany and the atrocities they committed along the way. The museum is structured in a way that helps attendees grasp not only the overall overarching story behind WW2 but countless individual stories that complete the experience and hold the true emotional impact . \n\nThe museum is multi level and anyone seeking to really enjoy it should accommodate to spend a large portion of their day here. Beside posters of information on the wall, there are  numerous historical relics and video/audio booths that run for 5-15 min with the next showing starting exactly 1 min after the previous one ends. Thankfully, my girlfriend and I visited on Jan. 24, which happened to be the March for Life, so we encountered little to no foot traffic until about 2 pm. With that said, we arrived at the museum at 12 and even with those 2 hours practically alone we still spent nearly 5 hours in the museum in order to read and enjoy everything they had to offer at our own pace. \n\nThe museum security were very thorough and quick. Admission was free and during the month of January there is no need to book a time slot online beforehand. Possibly because it isn't as busy. An absolute must visit museum.
