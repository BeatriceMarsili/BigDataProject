I think everyone realizes this. The different temporary exhibits have been so wonderful and special. I have seen so much great art. There is a variety in the kind of art that they decide to show, both in terms of their temporary exhibitions and their permanent collection. There is always a good variety of modern artists who have decades upon decades of work and experience, as well as more experimental and newer artists. They choose to show everything art can possibly be, which I absolutely love. They also have a variety of events to check out. The museum is constantly trying new things and I really appreciate it.
