You'll see beautiful, thought-provoking pieces and learn something along the way. If African art is a passion, be sure to check out this museum as it has the best collection in the world.

If you are in the DC area I definitely suggest stopping by. Or dedicating at list one day of your trip to museum hop. The Smithsonian has a few different museums also a castle which is pretty cool as well! The museum was not crowded it\u2019s a great place to take refuge on a hot day or a really cold day.
