The Jane Goodall exhibit was really well-thought out and organized. Slightly text-heavy but also had a lot of really interesting visual displays, including a replica field tent. I ended up learning a lot more about her life and chimps than I expected. Even reading every label and display, we finished the Goodall exhibit in about an hour a half, so it is a smaller museum. There was a second exhibition on photography featuring women which was also very interesting. It was nice to see so many different, admirable women in various roles and how they got there. Overall, would highly recommend for varied, rotating exhibits and more of a low-key museum experience than the Smithsonians.", "time": 1578411148}, {"author_name": "Andrew Minagar", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103232784360776758832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Gpu338kf-tI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/9f2Ta5HG_wY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "Great for every type of tourist!
