It\u2019s a wonderful place to bring the kids, honestly that\u2019s the main reason I come here, children are well entertained and occupied while you relax on a hammock. No eating in the lawn exhibition. After you are done relaxing, if the kids still have energy then you can take them to the kids center, where there are kids-size buildings-like a house, hardware store, a few fun activities and lots of toys- please remember you have to replace all toys after the kids finish playing. There is also another section with foam blocks that the kids can be entertained in also. There is a place to purchase food, but there is not a large selection and it\u2019s a little pricey.
