Entry to the zoo is free but parking is $30. I wouldn't recommend taking your time out of a vacation to go here, your local zoo is probably just as good.

The heat was a challenge for us as well, but was manageable by taking breaks in the air conditioned indoor exhibits that were open.\n     I can't stress, the importance of bringing enough hydrating beverages.  Although they are available for purchase at the park, it is incredibly pricey.  There are many places to sit and rest in the shade, and picnicing seems to be encouraged in several of them.  Strollers are available for hire, at a reasonable price, and everything is very stroller accessible.  While pamphlets/maps we're not available at time, there were many maps and guides scattered throughout the entire park, and it was quite easy to navigate.  \n     We traveled in via the Metro, and it was a quick and relatively easy walk from the station to the Zoo's main pedestrian entrance.  You have to register for free tickets (admittance is always free of charge), for specific time, to show up on entry.  This is to track the Zoo's capacity, do to covid-19 policies.
