One of the best parts about the zoo is that it's free if you walk to the zoo you can walk right in and you don't have to pay anything. However, if you drive there and you want to park, parking cost $25. That's a lot for parking especially if you're going by yourself however if you're going with the family and you have three or four or five people with you $25 is not bad at all especially considering you don't have to pay an entrance fee. If you want to see the giant pandas try and get there early in the morning that's when they're usually outside and most active. The Cheetahs are usually out all day long so you can see them and they're very cool. If you get to the Lions around 3:30 you might be able to hear the male lion roar calling in his pride. The Gray Wolf is another one of my favorites she's usually there walking around sort of pacing back and forth. She's old about 16 years old so she doesn't do a whole lot of running and playing but she does do a lot of pacing back and forth so you should be able to see her. the tigers are usually lazy and just sit around even the Cubs are pretty lazy but you should be able to see them even when they are just lying around. There's lots of other cool animals so just wander explore the zoo and have a good time.", "time": 1583713937}, {"author_name": "S G", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118409196171602771109/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-vR7X2ZJLYIQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/KW8ZBkIKQ74/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "What's the greatest wish of a Panda? To take a color photo :-P\n\nSorry for that lame humor but the highlight of this zoo? P.A.N.D.A!!! Where else can you see them and for free!? They were absolutely the cute thing. It was a nice balmy day when we went so the Pandas were not outside. It greatly disappointed us initially to think that we missed them and had to see them through a monitor only. But a few more steps from the Panda look out, there was an interior look through the mirror conservatory where the Pandas happily cowed their bamboo! They were so close and they are absolutely worth seeing!\n\nOther than that, the zoo is pretty much the same as other zoos and it's located on a steep hill... So be prepared to hike here.
