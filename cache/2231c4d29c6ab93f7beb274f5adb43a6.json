"One of the last activities I did on my Washington trip. I was really interested in this museum because of the interactive activities as well as the spy knowledge. Looking at the reviews, it's clear this is a hit or miss activity and I get why. \n\nToo many people, not enough kiosks, and they let in batches of people in too big groups. \n\nWe visited on a Tuesday morning, I had bought the tickets in advance online. Once we arrived, we enter the elevator and cool mini clip plays and tells you about your mission, once you get out, a worker gives you your lanyard and key card and you go to a kiosk to assume an identity. It's a pretty fun game! You get a codeword and a fake name with a fake job, residence, and mission. My name was Ellery Green, I was from Spain, and my mission was to infiltrate a flower shop I think. \n\nAfter that is set up, you go into a room and you watch a short film narrated by Morgan Freeman and features testimonials from real spies. \n\nAnd that's when it gets busy, you are lead to the museum and the kiosks are initially hard to find and once you find them it takes a second before you understand you need to click on your code word which unlocks your identity and mission. The kiosks get busy fast and because everyone is learning how to maneuver them at the same time, it gets long. I initially started by going to the far end of the museum and working my way back to the front so that I avoided most lines at the kiosks, problem was once I made my way back to the beginning, tons more groups had joined and the lines were waaaaay too long. \n\nI think your best bet is to just go to whatever kiosk has the shortest line, since you don't have to do them in order. I'd skip the first room altogether, it's too busy and isn't really worth it, especially if you have kids. \n\nThe activities are fun though, I won't lie. One of them is seeing if you can hang from a pole with fake wind blowing. Another is a game to see if your partner will lie to you and if they do you get an electric shock. \n\nI don't think it's worth $25 and I don't think it's a good place to take your children if they are under a certain age. Tons of kids were too young to understand the missions and felt frustrated and would just tap on whatever was happening on the screen. \n\nI think the museum should feature a special adults only hour so that we ca really appreciate the history that they display on the walls as well as the interactive mission part. The way it is set up now, you're just running around hoping to get to a kiosk to do a mission and you completely miss the aspect of the museum which is the facts and the costumes and gadgets that are on display. \n\nMy advice:\n-Get there early on a weekday\n-Skip the beginning kiosks unless they are empty\n-Do the kiosks first and then go back and read the displays.", "time": 1584244916}, {"author_name": "Madalyn Lejeune", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112734662418975559016/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-tx4wXTNq6MI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/LCVTPZucPZo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Brilliant concept for an attraction, execution could use updating. The sheer number of people lining up to use the monitors nearly kills the interactive experience. For the price of admission, we shouldn't have to spend half of the time waiting in lines and competing for space with hordes of kids running around. Consider limiting number of entries per hour. Consider integrating exhibits and \"missions\" with personal devices. This would surely streamline the experience and ensure more guests have an enjoyable and interactive experience. There are plenty of neat and historical displays to check out, aside from that.", "time": 1579486296}, {"author_name": "shabbyfoofoo yay", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115410944337724538474/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-xD7Q-0ZKoCI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/dF51eJ02JxE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "For my family, it was perfect. However, I would only recommend this place if you are traveling with an older group - like ages 11+. The International Spy Museum has very cool and informative exhibits and a good amount of interactive aspects. \nBut, I recommend for an older audience because a lot of it is reading posters, looking at artifacts, and watching videos. In addition, the information is more mature as it shares true stories of spies, crimes, and wars.\nOverall, you should definitely visit this place! Great for a midday outing with an older group - and adults will enjoy too.

It\u2019s not just about historical spymasters, but codes and intelligence gathering as well. \nI really recommend getting here at 945am because they actually let you queue for the first showing which starts at 10am.
