She was well informed, engaging, and provided a balance of art history, interpretive commentary, and some tidbits of trivia. \n\nThe outdoor sculpture garden had a few very good pieces in it.

The Kreeger Museum is a small, art gallery in NW DC between the neighborhoods of Foxhall Village and Glover Park. If you are driving or biking by the museum, it would be easy to mistake it for just another NW mansion, but it's more than that.\n\nIt's the former home of David Lloyd Kreeger and his wife, Cameron. Professionally, David ran GEICO for years. Personally, he collected art and invested in developing the next generation of artists. His home now showcases his art collection in 4-5 rooms. However, the real gem is in the outdoor courtyard. It's beautifully designed and when the sunsets the light bounces off its design. There's a fountain too making it a dream location for a DC event. Around the corner from the courtyard is a sculpture garden that is not to be missed.\n\nIf you're a DC local, it's a must-do. There's a suggested donation of $10 to get in and I recommend paying it to support the museum.
