"I want to love this museum but it could be so much more. The exhibits are small for starters. There is a lot of time and space spent on the \u201ctreaties\u201d period as well as the use of Indian symbols, etc in media, advertising, and stereotypes. Where are the exhibits on the history and culture of different tribes. There is a rich history that people want to learn about and frankly need to lear about, and that is largely missing here. There is some, but not nearly enough. Make this place somewhere we can come to learn and celebrate the fantastic history, tradition, and culture of Native American people groups. The focus on treaties and racist advertisement, while it needs to be talked about,  doesn\u2019t make sense and lacks depth without first going in depth on history/culture/government/etc. The National Museum of African American History and Culture really sets the standard for what this museum could be. I\u2019m hopeful! There is a fairly good and popular interactive exhibit for children on the third floor, and there are rotating exhibits as well as events. Definitely go, and hopefully it will get better with time.", "time": 1579974666}, {"author_name": "Rani McLingato", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110482730153819334791/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-dFrj1FGo32g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xRP1QyBwCwQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "So much information!
