Large wide ranging museum covering various aspects of American life and history. Some really interesting exhibits. Needs a whole day to get anywhere near the best out of the museum. Could have spent a lot longer here.\nGenerally speaking the descriptors against the exhibits were adequate for the casual visitor.\nTwo things were frustrating. Firstly the food in the cafe was very expensive, $30 US for a salad. With 4 of us plus drinks over $100 is way too much for a basic lunch. \nSecondly the exhibition on first ladies was basically a display of their frocks and china. I'm pretty sure that many of these amazing people would want to be known for more than wearing a pretty dress at the inaugural ball. Where as there was lots of interesting information about the Male presidents. Felt quite sexist. I made a written observation at the information desk and the very helpful member of staff told me that the museum responded to all complaints/observations in person. Months later I've heard nothing.\nI could not give this museum 4 stars because of the cost of food and poor first lady exhibition.", "time": 1582380725}, {"author_name": "Brandon Perkins", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038026865711645907/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-uzwDw0HO8Kc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/JneFYRWbIAc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "This is one of the best natural history museums!
