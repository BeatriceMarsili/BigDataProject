It's small compared to its sister museums so a visit shouldn't last more than an hour. The exhibits were eye-opening and informative, highlighting issues of displacement, segregation, and discrimination faced by DC's marginalized communities, and how they and their allies organized to tackle and overcome those issues. It's really stunning how all of these happened right where the nation's seat of power is.\n\nThis place is out of the way for most visitors, especially for those without a car.

Despite this, if you live in DC, it's worth for these reasons:\n\n1) It's a community museum and highlights the marginalized in our city and advocates for community, advocacy, and identity. They invite you to interact with the each exhibit asking yourself about how you define freedom and identity. If anything, it makes you reflect and think.\n\n2) It only takes 15-30 minutes to go through so if you need a quick trip, it's for you.\n\n3) The building is beautiful and there are a few murals inside that are striking.\n\n4) There's a nice park next door with picnic tables to enjoy the outdoors.\n\n5) It's free and they host some great events also for free.\n\nIf you're a tourist and short on time in DC, skip this one. if you're a local, visit this place at least once!", "time": 1504053504}], "scope": "GOOGLE", "types": ["museum", "tourist_attraction", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=16913463961308335857", "user_ratings_total": 207, "utc_offset": -240, "vicinity": "1901 Fort Place Southeast, Washington", "website": "http://anacostia.si.edu/"}, "status": "OK"}
