In my humble opinion though this is the best one! Man what an experience I had. The security guards were terrific, food was cheap and delicious, I went there with my 1st friends and family. Everyone there treated me so kindly and politely like I was their family. I forgot I was in a museum and thought I was at a family's house who collects massive realistic airplanes and space shuttles. All my friends and family learned so much and had so much fun, heck we even played in the simulator for a bit, what a time that was! Everyone in my group agree this is 5 stars! The gift shop was amazing and reasonably price. Would recommend for anyone, but sadly I must give it one star because some homeless man told me to, I'm sorry Mr. Smithsonian but I must give into the homeless person's needs before a rich mans. But I'm glad this place is free because their exhibits are too amazing to cost money!
