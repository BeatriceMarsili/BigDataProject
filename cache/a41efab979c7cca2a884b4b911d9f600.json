It was an absolutely humbling experience ! Where do you start ? The layout is phenomenal ! You really could take two days to go through everything. If you have the time start on the bottom and work your way through. My favorite sections were the slave house, black panther party section, segregated train and the Oprah section. They have several interactive things throughout the museum as well. I like how they even mentioned controversial subjects like project housing also. All the way up to current events. On the main floor is the food court and the food was delicious! I had the Mac and cheese with collard greens and fried chicken and cornbread. Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. Parking was the only challenge but I parked a few blocks away and walked. There was a line outside but I only waited for about 10 minutes. This was something I had wanted to do for a long time and traveled all the way from Atlanta to experience and it was completely worth it and I will remember it forever. Hopefully I will be able to come back again soon. !", "time": 1593245449}, {"author_name": "Frankie J", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111740675310646999779/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-jl5VkuT7zkk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/d9OPPvi1DfI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "I give National Museum of African American History and Culture located at 1400 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20560 FIVE STARS.
