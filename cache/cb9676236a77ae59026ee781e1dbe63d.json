We went on a weekday and fortunately the waiting time to go to one of the buildings of the military base that the museum is on to pass a background check was fortunately faster than we expected (better to allow yourself some time for background check and definitely go on a weekday if you want to enter the navy museum the same day you do the background check). Once inside the Navy museum some of the multiple exhibits that my husband and I obtained the chance to visit: a 240 year multi portrait snapshot of the U.S. Navy ranging from the 1700s to the modern time period, other camouflage techniques exhibit, Finding Position At Sea exhibit, some model exhibits of multiple aircraft carriers that have been part of the U.S. naval fleet, an exhibit featuring a quote by a science fiction author who was a graduate of the U.S. Navy Academy, an exhibition of silverware used for special dining occasions on certain ships for naval officers, an exhibit titled Society of Sponsors that included some of the individuals affiliated with the christening ceremonies of some of the ships that were put into commission for sea service some time after construction, a Fleet Service Schools exhibit, Into A New Eras Exhibit, Pacific Logistics exhibit, Carrier Aviation exhibit, Museum Education Center exhibit, historic Join The Navy portrait advertisement portrait, a store inside the Navy Museum. My sweetheart husband purchased a 2020 Navy Calendar and a navy t-shirt as part of my birthday gifts. The employees that we interacted with both inside the museum and navy museum store were cordial and my amazing husband visiting with me for my birthday was a surreal experience because we both unexpectedly met each other in the navy over 17 years ago.", "time": 1573348911}, {"author_name": "Joel Tootill", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489944993233596949/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-xsUxaDAIV-s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QlMAdRwOxoo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "An excellent place to spend an afternoon reviewing our country's Naval history.", "time": 1576577554}], "scope": "GOOGLE", "types": ["museum", "tourist_attraction", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=17097340197956661041", "user_ratings_total": 293, "utc_offset": -240, "vicinity": "736 Sicard Street Southeast, Washington", "website": "http://www.history.navy.mil/museums/NationalMuseum/org8-1.htm"}, "status": "OK"}
