of the United States Navy, or U.S. Navy Museum for short, is the flagship museum of the United States Navy and is located in the former Breech Mechanism Shop of the old Naval Gun Factory on the grounds of the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., United States. The U.S. Navy Museum is one of ten official Navy museums, and is part of the Naval History & Heritage Command, the official history program of the United States Navy. The U.S. Navy Museum was established in 1961 and opened to the public in 1963. As one of 15 Navy museums throughout the country, it is the only one that presents an overview of U. S. naval history. Permanent and temporary exhibitions commemorate the Navy's wartime heroes and battles as well as its peacetime contributions in exploration, diplomacy, space flight, navigation and humanitarian service. Known for 40 years as the flagship museum of the U.S. Navy, The U.S. Navy Museum celebrates a legacy of educating the public. In the tradition of its predecessors on the Washington Navy Yard beginning in 1865, the current museum features a collection that dates from 1800. The museum's collection moved twice before Admiral Arleigh Burke established the current museum, Building 76, in 1963 to create an American naval history museum comparable to those in Europe. The U.S. Navy Museum continues to embody Burke's vision of sharing the Navy's history and traditions with the world. The tradition of collecting naval artifacts in the United States began in the early 19th century under the command of Thomas Tingey, the first commandant of the Washington Navy Yard. The first artifact collected was a French gun, cast in 1793 at Lyons, captured during the Quasi-War with France, 1798\u20131801. From this modest beginning, the collection grew as the U.S. Navy fought in more battles and explored the high seas during the early years of the American republic. As the Navy's collection of artifacts grew, so did the need for a space in which to display them. In 1865, the former Paint Shop opened as the Museum of Naval Relics and Weapons where the Dispensary is today. This museum was amongst America's earliest federal museums. Listed as one of Washington's most popular tourist attractions in Morrison's Strangers Guide to Washington, the collection impressed visitors with such artifacts as a gun from Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes's conquest of Mexico, and the sloop Kearsarge's original sternpost containing a shell she received during her fight with the Confederate raider Alabama off the French coast. In 1913 the museum's artifacts were moved to Building 120, where the museum shared space with the Seaman Gunner's Quarters and the Recruiting Office. This site is now a parking lot west of the Washington Navy Yard. The building was demolished in 1927, which left the Navy's collection of artifacts in storage for eight years. In April 1935, the third museum opened in building 40, at the north end of the Breech Mechanism Shop constructed between 1887 and 1899. When World War II ended the yard officially changed its name to the Naval Gun Factory, so the museum became the Naval Gun Factory Museum. After gun production ceased, Admiral Burke obtained the entire building in 1961 to house a new, and more complete collection of artifacts. Today The U.S. Navy Museum is the only naval museum to chronicle the history of the U.S. Navy from its creation to the present. Artifacts like USS Constitution's fighting top, the world's deepest diving submersible, Trieste, and the khaki uniform of former Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz make The Navy Museum's collection second to none. Close to 94,000 individuals visit The U.S. Navy Museum annually. Admission to the museum and its programs is free. The museum is architecturally accessible.", "time": 1591359171}, {"author_name": "Anthony Garcia", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112795978084923924261/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-rZgtfdKtFDo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/C_xr52nhbXw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Great overview of a lot of history here, and there are artifacts galore so it's much more entertaining than just the writing would be.", "time": 1582662075}, {"author_name": "Burke of Mellow Park", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104228825832976895894/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-HapuyME4cIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/t8QUR5aWUpw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Loved this museum.

Once inside the Navy museum some of the multiple exhibits that my husband and I obtained the chance to visit: a 240 year multi portrait snapshot of the U.S. Navy ranging from the 1700s to the modern time period, other camouflage techniques exhibit, Finding Position At Sea exhibit, some model exhibits of multiple aircraft carriers that have been part of the U.S. naval fleet, an exhibit featuring a quote by a science fiction author who was a graduate of the U.S. Navy Academy, an exhibition of silverware used for special dining occasions on certain ships for naval officers, an exhibit titled Society of Sponsors that included some of the individuals affiliated with the christening ceremonies of some of the ships that were put into commission for sea service some time after construction, a Fleet Service Schools exhibit, Into A New Eras Exhibit, Pacific Logistics exhibit, Carrier Aviation exhibit, Museum Education Center exhibit, historic Join The Navy portrait advertisement portrait, a store inside the Navy Museum. My sweetheart husband purchased a 2020 Navy Calendar and a navy t-shirt as part of my birthday gifts.
