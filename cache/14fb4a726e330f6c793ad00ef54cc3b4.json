The luncheon of the boating party by Renoir is just one of many highlights. Even one of my favorite expressionists (Franz Marc) made it into the Phillips Collection. They have a superb variety of artists and styles. I like how they displayed the paintings. The rooms are decent sized so you don\u2019t have to squeeze yourself through masses of people gathered around a single painting. Staff was very engaging and was fast giving you an explanation for some of the art work you were looking at. Great museum cafe with the possibility to sit outside in the sun. If you have to decide for one museum in DC the Phillips collection should be your go to museum. Even though you have to pay an entrance fee it is totally worth it.
