It just shows how the bible has affected lives and world history and doesn't highlight the beliefs of any particular religious denomination. I thought that was refreshing and gave me the chance to roam the museum without feeling as if I might run into someone who wants to hand me their church card. (No offense as I have done that before myself in other settings but no longer) No, it was an experience of learning as all good museums are with people roaming the staircases and hallways with various levels of interests (religious or non) that they were free to pursue. I went on a quiet day with few tourists and loved every moment of the mental solitude for personal reflection and inventory of my own beliefs. The food was great and the atmosphere was peaceful. I also saw the special exhibit of light at the bottom of the museum which was truly stunning. It should be there until March 2020 says a staff member I asked so go see it while you can.The museum is well organized and is well staffed with competent, inviting, welcoming personnel. I felt comfortable in that there was no pressure/expectation to adopt a belief but to broaden my mind and deepen my understanding. Great museum.
