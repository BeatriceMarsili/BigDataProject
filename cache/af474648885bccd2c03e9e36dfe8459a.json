They also have their own greenhouses and propagation house where they have a very outstanding orchid collection and impressive production space for all of the plants they display in the gardens.  That is certainly worth the visit if possible and if you enjoy plants and botany as I do. \nThe inside of the estate has many historical paintings and pieces that are worth visiting and viewing.  They charge a small fee for entrance, but it is certainly worth it.  I would avoid taking children under the age of 10, as it may not be the most exciting place to visit, but it\u2019s in a gorgeous part of D.C. and is certainly worth it.
