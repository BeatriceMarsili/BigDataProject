# BigDataProject
This is the repo from Group #17 (*A student*: **Ivan Martini**, *B student*: **Beatrice Marsili**) about the course project 2019/2020 of **Big Data Technologies @ UniTN**

## Startup
The core of the project is the python programming language, version 3. The goal will be using Flask and Apache Spark (pyspark) to achieve the best result. Everything runs on a python virtual environment (in order to avoid compatilibity issues on different devices).
All the required modules are coming with the repo. Before working on anything, start the virtual environment:

`
$ 	. virtual/bin/activate 
` 

While in the virtual environment and module packet downloaded will be stored locally. The changes to any file, however, will persist. To quit the virtual environment just type:

`
$ 	deactivate
`
